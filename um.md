A _derivative security_ is a contract between two parties: I will
give you this on these dates if you will give me that on those dates.
Derivatives must have existed since before recorded history.  The Nobel
prize winning breakthrough of Black, Scholes, and Merton was to show
how to synthesize derivatives by dynamically trading market instruments
based on the borrowing cost used to fund the hedge instead of trying to
estimate the the actual growth rate of the underlying securities.

This short note provides a unified model for valuing, hedging, and
managing the risk of any derivative security. It shows how they can
be synthesized by trading market instruments and turns the spotlight on
what may be the next Nobel prize winning problem: how should you hedge
if you can't do it continuously?

## Notation

If $\AA$ is an
[_algebra_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_of_sets)
on the set $\Omega$ we write
$X\colon\AA\to\mathbf{R}$ to indicate $X\colon\Omega\to\mathbf{R}$
is $\AA$-[_measurable_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurable_function).
If $\AA$ is finite then the
[_atoms_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(measure_theory))
of $\AA$ form a
[_partition_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_a_set)
of $\Omega$ and being measurable is
equivalent to being constant on atoms. In this case $X$ is indeed a function
on the atoms.

If $\AA$ is an algebra of sets, the
[_conditional expectation_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_expectation)
of $X$ given
$\AA$ is defined by $Y = E\left\lbrack X | \AA\right\rbrack$ if and only
if $Y$ is $\AA$ measurable and $\int_A Y\,dP = \int_A X\,dP$
for all $A\in\AA$. This is equivalent to $Y(P|_\AA)
= (XP)|_\AA$ where the vertical bar indicates restriction of a measure.

A _filtration_ indexed by $T\subseteq [0,\infty)$ is an increasing
collection of algebras, $(\AA_t)_{t\in T}$.  A process
$M_{t}\colon\AA_{t} \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$, $t\in T$, is
a _martingale_ if $M_t = E[M_u | \AA_t] = E_t[M_u]$ for $t\le u$.

A _stopping time_ is a function $\tau\colon\Omega\to T$ such that
$\{\omega\in\Omega\mid \tau(\omega) \le t\}$ belongs to $\AA_t$, $t\in T$.

## Market Model

Every _instrument_ has a _price_, $X_t$, and a _cash flow_, $C_t$, at any
trading time, $t\in T$.  Instruments are assumed to be perfectly liquid:
they can be bought or sold at the given price in any amount. Cash flows
are associated with owning an instrument and are almost always 0, e.g., stocks
have dividends, bonds have coupons, European options have exactly one
cash flow at expiration, futures always have price 0.

A _market model_ specifies _prices_
$X_{t}:\AA_{t} \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^{I}$, and _cash flows_
$C_{t}:\AA_{t} \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^{I}$, where $I$ are the
available market instruments.

## Trading

A _trading strategy_ is a finite collection of strictly increasing
stopping times, $\tau_{j}$, and trades, $\Gamma_{j}:\AA_{\tau_{j}}
\rightarrow \mathbf{R}^{I}$ indicating the number of shares to trade
in each instrument. Trades accumulate to a _position_, $\Delta_{t} =
\sum_{\tau_{j} < t}\Gamma_{j} = \sum_{s < t}\Gamma_{s}$ where $\Gamma_{s}
= \Gamma_{j}$ when $s = \tau_{j}$.  Note the trade at time $t$ is not
included in the position at time $t$: it takes some time for trades
to settle.

The _value_ (or _mark-to-market_) of a position at time $t$ is $V_{t} =
\left( \Delta_{t} + \Gamma_{t} \right) \cdot X_{t}$: what you would get
from liquidating your existing position and the trades just executed.
The _amount_ generated by the trading strategy at time $t$ is $A_{t} =
\Delta_{t} \cdot C_{t} - \Gamma_{t} \cdot X_{t}$: you receive the cash
flows associated with your existing position and pay for the trades you
just executed.

## Arbitrage

Arbitrage is a trading strategy with $A_{\tau_{0}} > 0$, $A_{t} \geq 0$
for $t > \tau_{0}$ and $\sum_{j}^{}{\Gamma_{j} = 0}$: you make money
on the first trade and never lose until the strategy is closed out.

The Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing states there is no arbitrage
if and only if there exists a _deflator_, $D_{t}:\AA_{t} \rightarrow \left(
0,\infty \right)$, with

$$\begin{matrix}
X_{t}D_{t} = E_t[X_v D_v + \sum_{t < u \leq v} C_u D_u].\label{eq:1} \\
\end{matrix}$$

We can assume $D_0 = 1$. If $(D'_t)$ is a deflator then so is $(D'_t/D'_0)$.

Note that if $C_t = 0$ for all $t \in T$, this says $X_tD_t$ is a
martingale. If the prices are eventually 0, this says the current price
is the expected price of discounted future cash flows.  A consequence
of the above and the definition of value and amount is

$$\begin{matrix}
V_t D_t = E_t[V_v D_v + \sum_{t < u \leq v}A_u D_u].\label{eq:2} \\
\end{matrix}$$

Note the similarity to the previous displayed equation. Value
corresponds to price and amount corresponds to cash flow.
This equation is the skeleton key for valuing derivative securities.

If $u > t$ is sufficiently small then $X_t D_t = E_t[(X_u + C_u) D_u]$
and $V_t D_t = (\Delta_{t} + \Gamma_t)\cdot X_{t} D_t = \Delta_u\cdot
E_t[(X_u + C_u) D_u]$.  Since $\Delta_u\cdot C_u = \Gamma_u\cdot X_u +
A_u$ we have $V_t D_t = E_t[(\Delta_u\cdot X_u + \Gamma_u\cdot X_u +
A_u) D_u] = E_t[(V_u + A_u)D_u]$. The formula above follows by induction.

For a trading strategy that closes out,
$V_{\tau_0} D_{\tau_0} = E_{\tau_0}[\sum_{t > \tau_{0}}{A_{t}D_{t}] \geq 0}$. 
Since $V_{\tau_0} =
\Gamma_{\tau_0} \cdot X_{\tau_0}$, $A_{\tau_0} = - \Gamma_{\tau_0} \cdot X_{\tau_0}$, and $D_{\tau_0} > 0$ we have
$A_{\tau_0} \leq 0$.
This proves the "easy" direction of the FTAP.

There is no need to prove the "hard" direction since we have a large supply of arbitrage free models:
every arbitrage-free model has the form
$X_{t}D_{t} = M_{t} - \sum_{s \leq t}{C_{s}D_{s}}$ where
$M_{t}:\AA_{t} \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^{I}$ is a martingale and
$D_{t}:\AA_{t} \rightarrow (0,\infty)$.
This is immediate by substituting
$X_{v}D_{v} = M_v - \sum_{s\le v} C_s D_s$ in the first displayed equation.

## Valuing

If a derivative security pays amounts $B_j$ at times $\upsilon_j$ and there is
a hedge, $(\Gamma_t)_{t\in T}$, that replicates these amounts, the value
of the derivative is the cost of setting up the initial hedge: $\Gamma_0\cdot X_0$.
The hedge must satisfy $A_t = 0$ if $t\not=\upsilon_j$ for all $j$ (_self financing_)
and $A_t = B_j$ if $t = \upsilon_j$ for some $j$.

The formula $V_0 = E[\sum_j B_j D_{\upsilon_j}]$ is the
value of the initial hedge, $\Gamma_0\cdot X_0$. It can be computed using the
derivative security payments and the deflator.

An European option has a single payment, $B_T$, at a fixed time $T$
and has value $V_0 = E B_T D_T$. Sometimes it is useful to compute this
as $E B_T D_T = E^* B_T E D_T$, where $E^*$ is the expected value under
the Esscher transform of the probability measure defined by $dP^*/dP =
D_T/E D_T$. $P^*$ is called the _forward measure_.

The only problem with this is ... Not only is it impossible to trade in continuous time, it leads to absured results.

## Hedging


The trades at time $t$ are similarly determined by $\Delta_t + \Gamma_t =
dV_t/dX_t$, where the last term is the Fr&#233;chet derivative.  Since we
know the position, $\Delta_t$, at time $t$ this determines the trades,
$\Gamma_t = dV_t/dX_t - \Delta_t$.

In the continuous time case where stocks are modelled by geometric
Brownian motion, this becomes classical Black-Scholes/Merton
delta hedging where delta is $\Delta$ and gamma is $\Gamma$. 
Under their mathematical assumptions, the hedge perfectly replicates the derivative.

In the real world, it is not possible to perfectly replicate the derivative security.
There is still research to be done on how to mangage this risk.

## Examples

The Black-Scholes/Merton model is specified by
$M_t = (r, s\exp(\sigma B_t - \sigma^2t/2)$ and $D_t = \exp(-\rho t)$.
No need for Ito's lemma, self-financing conditions, or PDE's, much less
the Hahn-Banach theorem.

## Canonical Deflator

There is a canonical choice for a deflator if repurchase agreements are available.

A _repurchase agreement_ at time $t$, $R_t$, has price $X^{R_t}_t = 1$
and cash flow $C^{R_t}_{t + dt} = R_t$ so for any arbitrage free model
$D_t = E_t[R_tD_{t+dt}]$.  Define the _forward repo rate_, $f_t$,
by $R_t = \exp(f_t\,dt)$. The _canonical deflator_ is $D_t =
\exp(-\int_0^t f_s\,ds)$.  As we will see below, the prices of all
(non-risky) fixed income
securites are determined by the deflator.

### Zero Coupon Bond

A _zero coupon bond_ pays one unit at maturity $u$ so
it has a cash flow of 1 unit at time $u$.
An arbitrage free model requires the price at time $t$, $Z_t(u)$, to
satisfy $Z_t(u)D_t = E_t D_u$, so $Z_t(u) = \exp(-\int_t^u f_s\,ds)$.

### Forward Rate Agreement

A _forward rate agreement_ pays $-1$ unit at the
_effective date_ $u$, and $1 + f\delta(u,v)$ at the
_termination date_ $v$, where $f$ is the _coupon_ and $\delta(u,v)$ is the [_day count
fraction_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_count_convention) for the
interval $[u,v]$.  The day count fraction is approximately equal to the time in years from
$u$ to $v$ for any _day count basis_.

The _par coupon_ at time $t$, $F_t(u,v;\delta)$ is the coupon that makes the price at
time $t\le u$ equal to $0$, $0 = E_t -D_u + (1 + F_t\delta(u,v))D_v$.
Hence $F_t(u,v;\delta) = (Z_t(u)/Z_t(v) - 1)/\delta(u,v)$ is determined by zero coupon
bond prices. Note $F_t\delta E_t D_v = E_t[D_u - D_v]$.

There are also forward rate agreements not involving the exchange of notional. A
(fixed rate) _payer_ has the single cash flow $(f - F_u(u,v;\delta))\delta(u,v)$ at time $v$.
A _receiver_ has the negative of this cash flow. The value at any time $t \le u$ is
determined by

\begin{align*}
X_t D_t &= E_t (f - F_u(u,v;\delta))\delta(u,v) D_v \\
        &= E_t f\delta(u,v) D_v - E_u[D_u - D_v]  \\
        &= E_t f\delta(u,v) D_v - D_u + D_v  \\
        &= E_t -D_u + (1 + f\delta(u,v)) D_v \\
\end{align*}

which is the same as for a forward rate agreement that does exchange notional.
These two types of FRAS's have very different risk characteristics.


## Remarks

The price of an instrument is not a number. Not only does it
depend on whether you are buying or selling, the amount being
purchased, and the counterparties involved, determine the price.

The atoms of finance are _exchanges_: $(t;a,i,c;a',i',c')$,
where $t$ is the time of the exchange, $a$ is the amount
of instrument $i$ the _buyer_, $c$, decides to obtain for the amount
$a'$ in instrument $i'$ the _seller_, $c'$, charges.

_Price_ is a function $X\colon T\times A\times I\times C\times I\times C\to \mathbf{R}$,
where $T$ is the set of trading times, $A$ the set of amounts that can be traded,
$I$ is the set of market instruments, and $C$ is the set of legal trading entities.

There is no need for a probability measure. The _dual_ of the space of bounded
functions on a set $\Omega$, $B(\Omega)$, is the space of finitely additive
measures on $\Omega$, $ba(\Omega)$.
