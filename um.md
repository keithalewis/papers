title: The Unified Model 
---

Let Ω be the set of what can happen in the world, $T$ be the allowed
trading times, ${(\mathcal{A}_{t})}_{t \in T}$ a collection of
increasingly fine partitions of Ω representing the information available
at each time, and $P$ a positive measure with mass 1 on the algebra
generated by the partitions.

The *unified model* specifies *prices*
$X_{t}:\mathcal{A}_{t} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{I}$, and *cash flows*
$C_{t}:\mathcal{A}_{t} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{I}$, where $I$ are the
available market instruments. Instrument prices are assumed to be
perfectly liquid: they can be bought and sold at the same price in any
amount. Cash flows are associated with owning an instrument: stocks have
dividends, bonds have coupons, futures have margin adjustments.

A *trading strategy* is a finite collection of strictly increasing
stopping times, $\tau_{j}$, and trades,
$\Gamma_{j}:\mathcal{A}_{\tau_{j}} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{I}$ indicating
the number of shares to trade in each instrument. Trades accumulate to a
*position*,
$\Delta_{t} = \sum_{\tau_{j} < t}\Gamma_{j} = \sum_{s < t}\Gamma_{s}$
where $\Gamma_{s} = \Gamma_{j}$ when $s = \tau_{j}$.

The *value* of a position at time $t$ is
$V_{t} = \left( \Delta_{t} + \Gamma_{t} \right) \cdot X_{t}$: also
called *marked-to-market*, is how much you would get from liquidating
your position and the trades just executed assuming you could do that.
The *amount* generated by the trading strategy at time $t$ is
$A_{t} = \Delta_{t} \cdot C_{t} - \Gamma_{t} \cdot X_{t}$: you receive
the cash flows associated with your existing position and pay for the
trades you just executed.

A process $M_{t}:\mathcal{A}_{t} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{I}$ is a
martingale if $M_{t}P = M_{u}P|_{\mathcal{A}_{t}}$. This is defined
for $A \in \mathcal{A}_{t}$ by
$M_{t}P\left( A \right) = \sum_{B \subset A}{M_{u}\left( B \right)P(B)}$
where $B \in$ $\mathcal{A}_{u}$. If $P$ is understood we write this as
$M_{t} = M_{u}|_{\mathcal{A}_{t}}$. The usual notation is
$M_{t} = E\left\lbrack M_{u} \middle| \mathcal{A}_{t} \right\rbrack.$

A model is *arbitrage-free* if there is no trading strategy with
$\sum_{j}{\Gamma_{j} = 0}$, $A_{\tau_{0}} > 0$ and
$A_{t} \geq 0$ for $t > \tau_{0}$. The Fundamental Theorem of Asset
Pricing states this is the case if and only if there exists a positive
adapted process,
$D_{t}:\mathcal{A}_{t} \rightarrow \left( 0,\infty \right)$, with

$$\begin{matrix}
X_{t}D_{t} = {(X}_{u}D_{u} + \sum_{t < s \leq u}{C_{s}D_{s}})|_{\mathcal{A}_{t}}\#\left( 1 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

Note that if $C_{t} = 0$ for all $t \in T$ this says $X_{t}D_{t}$ is a
martingale.

$$\begin{matrix}
V_{t}D_{t} = (V_{u}D_{u} + \sum_{t < s \leq u}{A_{s}D_{s}})|_{\mathcal{A}_{t}}\#\left( 2 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

For a strategy as above,
$V_{\tau_{0}}D_{\tau_{0}} = (\sum_{t > \tau_{0}}{A_{t} D_{t})|_{\mathcal{A}_{\tau_{0}}} \geq 0}$.
Since $V_{0} = \Gamma_{0} \cdot X_{0}$,
$A_{0} = - \Gamma_{0} \cdot X_{0}$, and $D_{0} > 0$ we have
$A_{0} \leq 0$, where the 0 subscript denote time $\tau_{0}$.

Every model of the form
$X_{t}D_{t} = M_{t} - \sum_{s \leq t}{C_{s}D_{s}}$ where
$M_{t}:\mathcal{A}_{t} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{I}$ is a martingale and
$D_{t}:\mathcal{A}_{t} \rightarrow (0,\infty)$ is a positive adapted
process is arbitrage-free. This is immediate by substituting
$X_{u}D_{u}$ in the first equation.
