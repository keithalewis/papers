# Algebras of Sets

* An _algebra of sets_ is a collection of subsets of a set.

* The subsets are called _events_.

* Algebras contain 

  * the empty set,
  * the complement of any set in the algebra,
  * and the union of any two sets in the algebra.

A subset of the powerset $\mathcal{P}(\Omega) = \{E\mid E\subseteq\Omega\}$,
$\mathcal{A}$, is an algebra if ...

An _atom_ of an algebra is a set $A\in\mathcal{A}$ with the property
$B\subseteq A$ and $B\in\mathcal{A}$ implies $B = A$ or $B = \emptyset$.

A _partition_ of a set is a collection of disjont subsets whos union is equal to the set.

If $\mathcal{A}$ is finite the atoms form a partition.

A partition is partial information.

Complete information is knowing exactly $\omega\in\Omega$.

No information is knowing only $\omega\in\Omega$.
