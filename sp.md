# Stochastic Processes

Let $S$ be a set of states and $T$ be a set of times that is totally
ordered, e.g., the integers or real numbers, or some subset of either.

Let $\Omega = S^T = \{\omega\colon T\to S\}$, all functions
from $T$ to $S$: what states can happen at each time.

Define $\Omega_t$ to be the equivalence relation on $\Omega$ by
$\omega \equiv \omega'$ if and only if $\omega(s) = \omega'(s)$
for $s\le t$.

Define a probability measure on ...

If $T$ and $S$ are finite
