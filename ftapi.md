SUMMARY
</div>
<p>
Over the past 12 years I have developed a unified approach to valuing, hedging,
and managing the risk of portfolios containing any instruments.
It can be explained in an hour to traders and risk managers.
I am looking for a company that wants to implement a real-time cross asset
valuation and risk management system that has knobs business people need and
can understand.
