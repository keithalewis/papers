# Finance - Math - Software

The financial world is a huge, complicated human endeavor.
No single person can even begin to comprehend its diversity.
Yet it exists and has a huge impact on everyone's daily life.

Mathematics can be used to grapple with a small subset of that.
It can add value by providing rigourous definitions of terms used
by practicioners and provide a simplified model amenable to rational
treatment.

Implementing financial models in software is a way to turn mathematics
into numbers that make sense to the people paying for that.
Mathematicians and programmers are ill prepared to understand the
complexity of the financial world but they can add value by
if they are willing to take a humble attitude and listen carefully
to the people with problems to solve.

Everyone in the Finance-Mathematics-Software loop can benefit from each
other to improve the quality of the modern, fast changing, world we
live in now. It can also be used to take advantage of people who don't
understand its workings.

What follows is my best understanding of what is involved and an attempt
to provide useful tools.

## Instrument

We use _instrument_ as a catch-all term for what can be traded in the
market.  Repurchase agreements (repos), stocks, bonds, cash deposits,
forward rate agreements, swaps, commodities. The word _securities_
can be used for these although that usually refers to stocks.
