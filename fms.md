# Finance - Math - Software

The financial world is a huge, complicated human endeavor.
No single person can even begin to comprehend its diversity.
Yet it exists and has a huge impact on everyone's daily life.

Mathematics can be used to grapple with a small subset of that.
It can add value by providing rigourous definitions of terms used
by practicioners and provide a simplified model amenable to rational
methods. It is important to be honest about the limitations of models.

Implementing financial models in software is a way to turn mathematics
into numbers that make sense to the people paying for that.

Everyone in the Finance-Mathematics-Software loop can benefit from
each other to improve the quality of the modern, fast changing, world
we live in now. It can also be used to take advantage of people who
don't understand its workings.

What follows is my best understanding of what is involved with that.

## Instruments

This is a catch-all term for what can be traded in the market.  Repurchase
agreements (repos), stocks, bonds, cash deposits, forward rate agreements,
swaps, commodities. The word _securities_ can be used for these although
that usually refers to stocks.
