# Vocabulary

Fischer Black emphasized the importance of vocabulary...

This is how human beings communicate.

Each entry provides a definition in plain English and assigns mathematical
names for the concepts. These are immediately followed by an exegesis
of the limitations involved in using mathematics to model the real world.

The real world is big, complicated, and messy. Mathematics can be used
to bring some order and rationality but will always remain a poor shadow.[1]

(who, what, when, where, why)

There are many participants in financial markets trading instruments
during market hours using the varied mechanisms available.

Every participant is a legal entity, either an individual or a
corporation, that can be held accountable for their actions. They
are governed by regulations that restrict what they can do and the
consequences of their actions. Most mathematical models do not take
this into account. 

Participants trade _instruments_, stocks, bonds, futures, options, to
name only a small subset. Instruments have _prices_ at which they are
bought and sold, and ownership (can) entail _cash flows_.

Stocks have dividends, bonds have coupons and principal, futures always
have price zero and (usually) daily margin adjustment cash flows,
options are contracts specifying their cash flows.

Usually instruments are traded on _exchanges_ or _over the counter_.

An exchange is a mechanism for _liquidity providers_ to advertise
the prices at which they are willing to buy or sell instruments.
The _customers_ of the exchange decide what trades they are willing
to make. Risk?

Over the counter trades occur between two parties. A buyer contacts
a seller and agree on the terms of the trade. 


The atoms of finance are _transactions_.
