# Datetime

A _datetime_ is a date and a time in a particular timezone.

In computer implementations it is useful to store datetimes
using UTC. User interfaces can translate that to local time
based on the prevailing timezone.

The [ISO 8601 standard](https://www.iso.org/standard/70908.html)
specifies an international standard for datetime format and
[RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) specifies
an internet standard that is slightly more permissive.
