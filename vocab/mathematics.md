# Mathematics

Everything in standard mathematics is a _set_ and all proofs involve only
_first order logic_. The _propositional calculus_ involves the words
'and', 'or', 'not', and 'implies' _First order logic_ introduces the
quantifiers 'there exists' and 'for every'.
Set theory defines set 'membership'.

A _proposition_ is a statement that can only take the values _true_
or _false_, the numeraire of logic.
