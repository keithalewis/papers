# Set Theory

_Set Theory_ involves _elements_, _members_, and _containment_.

Standard set theory uses the symbol epsilon, &epsilon;, to indicate memership.
The set _S_ is an _element_ of set _T_ is written _S_ &in; _T_ and we say
_S_ is a _member_ of _T_. The set _S_ is _contained in_ the set _T_ is written
_S_ &subseteq; _T_ and means every element of _S_ is also an element of _T_.


## Remarks

"The language of Set Theory is epsilon" is the flippant way logicians
describe set theory.

## Musings

Define set theory as a category with objects sets and arrows indicating containment.
Intersecton A &cap; B  is object with arrows A &cap; B &rarr; A, A &cap; B &rarr; B
such that for C &rarr; A, C &rarr; B there exists C &rarr; A &cap; B.

given C &rarr; A, C &rarr; B exists C &rarr; A &cap; B, C &rarr; A &cap; B ...

x &in; y iff x &rarry y
