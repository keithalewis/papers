# Mathematics

The entirety of mathematics can be expressed using a remarkably small vocabulary.
_Propositional Calculus_ uses the _connectives_, _not_, _and_, _or_, _implies_.
_First Order Logic_ adds _for every_ and _there exists_.
_Set Theory_ defines what it means for an _element_ to be a _member_ of a set.

In fact, this tiny vocabulary is redundant! All propositional connectives can
be defined in terms of _nand_ (not and). 'For every' can be defined using 'there
exists', and vice versa. An element is just a member of a set.

## Notes

The math game - come up with a list of axioms and rules of inference from which
all true propositions can be derived.

Hilbert's program. Goedel's theorem(s). (Completeness!)

Genzen's contributions.

Girard's linear logic. (Linear [cut free?] derivations).

Mathematics is not a monolith. Each area has its own theory.



## Remarks

- reduce human thought to calculation

George Boole "Laws of Thought, ON WHICH ARE FOUNDED THE MATHEMATICAL THEORIES OF LOGIC AND PROBABILITIES."

Not every proposition is amenable to mathematical analysis.
Spinoza was unable to come up with a system of axioms to
rigorously deduce that the quality of mercy is not strained.
Nevertheless, it is possible to provide a convincing argument
of its validity outside the realm of mathematics.

> The quality of mercy is not strained.  
    It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven  
    Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest:  
    It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.  
    'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes  
    The thronèd monarch better than his crown.  
    His scepter shows the force of temporal power,  
    The attribute to awe and majesty  
    Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;  
    But mercy is above this sceptered sway.  
    It is enthronèd in the hearts of kings;  
    It is an attribute to God Himself;  
    And earthly power doth then show likest God's  
    When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,  
    Though justice be thy plea, consider this:  
    That in the course of justice none of us  
    Should see salvation. We do pray for mercy,  
    And that same prayer doth teach us all to render  
    The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much  
    To mitigate the justice of thy plea,  
    Which, if thou follow, this strict court of Venice  
    Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant  
    there.
