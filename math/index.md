# Mathematics

The entirety of mathematics can be expressed using a remarkably small vocabulary.
_Propositional Calculus_ uses the _connectives_, _not_, _and_, _or_, _implies_.
_First Order Logic_ adds _for every_ and _there exists_.
_Set Theory_ defines what it means for an _element_ to be a _member_ of a set.

In fact, this tiny vocabulary is redundant! All propositional connectives can
be defined in terms of _nand_ (not and). 'For every' can be defined using 'there
exists', and vice versa. An element is just a member of a set.
