# Propositional Calculus

The _propositional calculus_ defines the rules for manipulating _propositions_.
A proposition is a statement that is either _true_ or _false_.

New propositions can be formed using the _logical connectives_: _not_,
_and_, _or_, _implies_.  

If $P$ is a proposition then _not_ $P$, written either $\lnot P$ or $\neg P$, is true
when $P$ is false and false when $P$ is true.

If $P$ and $Q$ are propositions then $P$ and $Q$, written $P\land Q$, is true when both $P$ is true
and $Q$ is true, otherwise it is false.

These, and the rest of the connecitves, can be summarized by a _truth table_:

| P | Q | $\lnot P$ | $P \land Q$ | $P \lor Q$ | $P\implies Q |
| :---: | :---:| :---:| :---:| :---:| :---: |
| T | T | F | T | T | T |
| T | F | F | F | T | F |
| F | T | T | T | T | T |
| F | F | T | F | F | T |


## Remarks


George Boole "Laws of Thought, ON WHICH ARE FOUNDED THE MATHEMATICAL THEORIES OF LOGIC AND PROBABILITIES."
- reduce human thought to calculation

Not every proposition is amenable to mathematical analysis.
Spinoza was unable to come up with a system of axioms to
rigorously deduce that the quality of mercy is not strained.
Nevertheless, it is possible to provide a convincing argument
of its validity outside the realm of mathematics.

> The quality of mercy is not strained.  
    It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven  
    Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest:  
    It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.  
    'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes  
    The thronèd monarch better than his crown.  
    His scepter shows the force of temporal power,  
    The attribute to awe and majesty  
    Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;  
    But mercy is above this sceptered sway.  
    It is enthronèd in the hearts of kings;  
    It is an attribute to God Himself;  
    And earthly power doth then show likest God's  
    When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,  
    Though justice be thy plea, consider this:  
    That in the course of justice none of us  
    Should see salvation. We do pray for mercy,  
    And that same prayer doth teach us all to render  
    The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much  
    To mitigate the justice of thy plea,  
    Which, if thou follow, this strict court of Venice  
    Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant  
    there.
