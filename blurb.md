The most important unsolved problem in applying Mathematical Finance to
problems faced by banks and large hedge funds is how manage the risk of
all the trades on their books.

historically single trades, portfolios, cross asset, ...

the trend is to incorporate all trades

very hard problem otherwise it would have already been solve.

advances in hardware and software engineering

wholeistic approach involve the process

von Neumann big picture approach

allow existing models to be incorporated

separate model parameters from fitting

give ML people something useful to do.

Example: CVA. What about unwinds?

There is an inexorible trajectory to the application of Mathematical
Finance to the business world.  Black-Scholes and Merton did Nobel Prize
winning research that turned option pricing into a science. This has
led to increasingly complicated models that incorporated more realistic
features of how markets work.

Technology is finally catching up to make real-time valuation, hedging, and risk management feasable.

The theory progressed from simple stock options[cite] to more exotic
options on a single stock[cite]. The next stage was Steve Ross showing
how to model portfolios of arbitrary instruments over one period[cite].
His work was ahead of its time and led to many papers trying to make
the mathematical claims more rigourous and extend the theory to work
for multiple period models.

One of the triumphs of Mathematical Finance has been its application to
Fixed Income securities. Dollar denominated swap products with maturities
up to 4 years have been quoted to basis point bid/ask spread since the
late 90's.

The Asian Crisis at that time led to the first steps toward incorporating
credit risk.
