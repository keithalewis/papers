The most important unsolved problem in applying Mathematical Finance to
problems faced by banks and large hedge funds is how manage the risk of
all the trades on their books.

historically single trades, portfolios, cross asset, ...

the trend is to incorporate all trades

very hard problem otherwise it would have already been solve.

advances in hardware and software engineering

holistic approach involve the process

von Neumann big picture approach

allow existing models to be incorporated

separate model parameters from fitting

give ML people something useful to do.

Example: CVA. What about unwinds?

The trajectory of the application of Mathematical Finance to the business
world tends inexorably toward models incorporating more realistic features
of how instruments and markets actually work.

Black-Scholes and Merton did Nobel Prize winning research that turned
option pricing into a science.  The theory progressed from simple stock
options to more exotic options on a single stock. The next stage was
Steve Ross showing how to model portfolios of arbitrary instruments
over one period.  His work was ahead of its time and led to a cottage
industry of papers trying to make the mathematical claims more rigorous
and extend the theory to work for multiple period models.

In the late 90's dollar denominated interest rate products with
maturities up to 4 years began to be quoted to basis point bid/ask
spreads.  After the Asian Crisis the first steps toward incorporating
credit risk to large portfolios started.

The financial crisis in 2008 provided stark illustration of the dangers
of not having a complete picture of the correlation between every market
instrument.  The ultimate goal is to make real-time valuation, hedging,
and risk management of every instrument feasible.

Technology has come to the point that it is now possible to do this.
I am up-to-date with software state of the art and have been working
for the past 10 years on the mathematical theory that allows a unified
approach to this problem.  I am looking a company that thinks this is
a project worth committing resources to.
