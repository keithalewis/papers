# SIGTech

SIGTech provides a cloud based platform for writing python applications
using Jupyter notebooks. It is used primarily for researching and
developing trading strategies across multiple asset classes.

It was originally developed for internal use at Brevan-Howard and
incorporates significant advances in financial modeling technology
but SIGTech is a completely separate legal entity.

They have proprietary and third party models for valuing instruments
and their greeks, and provide a means to include user models written
in python.

Their product is geared toward evaluating trading strategies.
SIGTech provides high quality building blocks for creating and testing
trading strategies. These use a Python dictionary based interface for
specifying arguments that that allow for portfolios of instruments from
any instrument class to created. They support all major instrument
classes including FX for cross-currency strategies.

They also provide a means to incorporate transaction costs including
user defined algorithms. This is crucial to practitioners in evaluating
any trading strategy.

They also have contracts with several data providers covering a wide range
of instruments. In addition to raw data they make available cleaned data.

## Notes

First time users need to be familiar with Jupyter. The blocks in their
examples need to be executed using Shift-Enter.

Their product does not have an offline mode.

There is no API to automate using their product but this is planned
for future releases.

Flat files of data can be uploaded and downloaded into Jupyter sessions.
