# SIGTech

SIGTech provides a cloud based platform for writing python applications
using Jupyter notebooks.

It was originally developed for internal use at Brevan-Howard and
incorporates significant advances in financial modeling technology.

They have proprietary and third party models for valuing instruments
and their greeks, and provide a means to include user models written
in python.

The world has moved past writing models to price single instruments.
Their product is geared toward evaluating trading strategies.  SIGTech
has a battle tested suite of strategies that allow for portfolios of
instruments from any instrument class to be tested.

They also provide a means to incorporate transaction costs. This is
crucial to practicioners in evaluating any trading strategy.

The most valuable component of their product might be the agreements
they negociated with their data providers.

## Notes

First time users need to be familiar with Jupyter. The blocks in
their examples need to be executed using Shift-Enter. There is
no feedback if you don't execute all of them in the order they
are presented.

Their product does not have an offline mode.

There seems to be no API to automate using their product.
