Unified Risk Management

The trajectory of the application of Mathematical Finance to the business
world tends inexorably toward models incorporating more realistic features
of how instruments and markets actually work.

Black-Scholes and Merton did Nobel Prize winning research that turned
option pricing into a science.  The theory progressed from simple stock
options to more exotic options on a single stock.
Steve Ross showed how to model portfolios of arbitrary instruments
over one period.  His work was ahead of its time and led to a cottage
industry trying to make his mathematical claims more rigorous
and extend the theory to work for multiple period models.

In the mid 90's dollar denominated interest rate products with
maturities up to 4 years began to be quoted to basis point bid/ask
spreads. The theory was a complete success for this class of
instruments.

After the Asian Crisis in the late 90's the first steps toward
incorporating credit risk to large portfolios appeared. The current XVA
menagerie of calculations stem from that lesson.

There is still a lot of work to be done to build systems that have a
unified approach to pricing, hedging, and managing the risk of portfolios
across all asset classes. 

Technology has reached the point where it is now possible to build a
system to do this.  I have been working for the past 10 years on the
mathematical theory to underpin this and am up to date with the latest
technology required to implement this.

I am looking for a company that believes getting a complete risk picture
is a competitive advantage. Not only will this help with day-to-day
management, but it can identify the sort of exposure that can put you out
of business.
