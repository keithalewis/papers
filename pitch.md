The trajectory of the application of Mathematical Finance to the business
world tends inexorably toward models incorporating more realistic features
of how instruments and markets actually work.

Black-Scholes and Merton did Nobel Prize winning research that turned
option pricing into a science.  The theory progressed from simple stock
options to more exotic options on a single stock. The next stage was
Steve Ross showing how to model portfolios of arbitrary instruments
over one period.  His work was ahead of its time and led to a cottage
industry of papers trying to make his mathematical claims more rigorous
and extend the theory to work for multiple period models.

In the mid 90's dollar denominated interest rate products with
maturities up to 4 years began to be quoted to basis point bid/ask
spreads. The theory was a complete success for this class of
instruments.

After the Asian Crisis in the late 90's the first steps toward
incorporating credit risk to large portfolios appeared. The current XVA
menagerie of calculations stem from that lesson.

Technology has come to the point that it is now possible to build
a system that can

I am up-to-date with software state of the art and have been working
for the past 10 years on the mathematical theory that allows a unified
approach to this problem.  I am looking for a company that
