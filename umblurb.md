# A Unified Model for Derivative Securities



The trajectory of the application of Mathematical Finance to the business
world tends inexorably toward models incorporating more realistic features
of how instruments and markets actually work.

Black-Scholes and Merton did Nobel Prize winning research that turned
option pricing into a science.  The theory progressed from simple stock
options to more exotic options on a single stock.
Steve Ross showed how to model portfolios of arbitrary instruments
over one period.  His work was ahead of its time and led to a cottage
industry trying to make his mathematical claims more rigorous
and extend the theory to work for multiple period models.

In the mid 90's dollar denominated interest rate products with
maturities up to 4 years began to be quoted to basis point bid/ask
spreads. The theory was a complete success for this class of
instruments.
