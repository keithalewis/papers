"I will give you this this on these dates if you will give me that on
those dates."

This is the essence of a _derivative security_: it is a contract between
two _parties_ for future exchanges. Barter and exchange go back even
before recorded history but derivatives introduce the uncertainty
of future events.
You don't need mutual trust to exchange three hand axes for a bear
skin. Once the transaction is done Korg and Grok can each go their
own way.  When an agreement to exchange at some future time comes into
play a new dynamic is involved.
