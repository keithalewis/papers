There is a unified way to value derivative
securities using market prices.

## Notation

If $\mathcal{A}$ is an
[algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra_of_sets)
on the set $\Omega$ we write
$X\colon\mathcal{A}\to\mathbb{R}$ to indicate $X\colon\Omega\to\mathbb{R}$
is $\mathcal{A}$-[_measurable_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurable_function).
If $\mathcal{A}$ is finite then the
[atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(measure_theory))
of $\mathcal{A}$ form a
[partition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_a_set)
of $\Omega$ and being measurable is
equivalent to being constant on atoms. In this case $X$ is indeed a function
on the atoms.

If $X$ is $\mathcal{A}$-measurable and $\mathcal{B}$ is a subalgebra
of $\mathcal{A}$ then the
[_conditional expectation_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_expectation)
of $X$ given
$\mathcal{B}$ is defined by $Y = E\left\lbrack X \middle| \mathcal{A}\right\rbrack$ if and only
if $Y$ is $\mathcal{B}$ measurable and $\int_B Y\,dP = \int_B X\,dP$
for all $B\in\mathcal{B}$. This is equivalent to $Y(P|_\mathcal{B})
= (XP)|_\mathcal{B}$ where the vertical bar indicates restriction of a measure to a subalgebra.

A _filtration_ on $T\subseteq [0,\infty)$ is an increasing
collection of algebras, $(\mathcal{A})_{t\in T}$.  A process
$M_{t}\colon\mathcal{A}{t} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, $t\in T$, is
a _martingale_ if $M_t P|_{\mathcal{A}} = M_u P|_{\mathcal{A}}$ for $t\le u$.  If $P$ is
understood we write this as $M_t = M_u|_{\mathcal{A}}$. The
usual notation is $M_t = E\left\lbrack M_{u} \middle| \mathcal{A}
\right\rbrack = E_t\left\lbrack M_u\right\rbrack.$

## Instruments

Every _instrument_ has a _price_, $X_t$, and a _cash flow_, $C_t$, at
any trading time, $t\in T$.  Instruments are assumed to be perfectly liquid:
they can be bought or sold at the given price in any amount. Cash flows
are associated with owning an instrument: stocks have dividends, bonds
have coupons, European options have exactly one cash flow at expiration.

## Model

The _unified model_ specifies _prices_
$X_{t}:\mathcal{A}{t} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{I}$, and _cash flows_
$C_{t}:\mathcal{A}{t} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{I}$, where $I$ are the
available market instruments.

A _trading strategy_ is a finite collection of strictly increasing
stopping times, $\tau_{j}$, and trades,
$\Gamma_{j}:\mathcal{A}{\tau_{j}} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{I}$ indicating
the number of shares to trade in each instrument. Trades accumulate to a
_position_,
$\Delta_{t} = \sum_{\tau_{j} < t}\Gamma_{j} = \sum_{s < t}\Gamma_{s}$
where $\Gamma_{s} = \Gamma_{j}$ when $s = \tau_{j}$.

The _value_ (or _mark-to-market_) of a position at time $t$ is
$V_{t} = \left( \Delta_{t} + \Gamma_{t} \right) \cdot X_{t}$:
what you would get from liquidating
your existing position and the trades just executed.
The _amount_ generated by the trading strategy at time $t$ is
$A_{t} = \Delta_{t} \cdot C_{t} - \Gamma_{t} \cdot X_{t}$: you receive
the cash flows associated with your existing position and pay for the
trades you just executed.

A model is _arbitrage-free_ if there is no trading strategy with
$\sum_{j}^{}{\Gamma_{j} = 0}$, $A_{\tau_{0}} > 0$ and
$A_{t} \geq 0$ for $t > \tau_{0}$: it is impossible to make money on
the first trade and never lose until the strategy is closed out.

The Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing states this is the case if
and only if there exists a function,
$D_{t}:\mathcal{A}{t} \rightarrow \left( 0,\infty \right)$, with

$$\begin{matrix}
X_{t}D_{t} = {(X}_{v}D_{v} + \sum_{t < u \leq v}^{}{C_{u}D_{u}})|_{\mathcal{A}{t}}\label{eq:1} \\
\end{matrix}$$

Note that if $C_{t} = 0$ for all $t \in T$ this says $X_{t}D_{t}$ is a
martingale. A consequence of the above and the definition of value and amount is

$$\begin{matrix}
V_{t}D_{t} = (V_{v}D_{v} + \sum_{t < u \leq v}A_{u}D_{u})|_{\mathcal{A}{t}}\label{eq:2} \\
\end{matrix}$$

If $u > t$ is sufficiently small then $X_{t} D_{t} = (X_u + C_u) D_u|_{\mathcal{A}}$
and $V_{t} D_t = (\Delta_{t} + \Gamma_t)\cdot X_{t} D_t
= \Delta_u\cdot (X_u + C_u)D_u|_{\mathcal{A}}$.
Since $\Delta_u\cdot C_u = \Gamma_u\cdot X_u + A_u$ we have
$V_{t} D_t = (\Delta_u\cdot X_u + \Gamma_u\cdot X_u + A_u) D_u|_{\mathcal{A}}
= (V_u + A_u)D_u|_{\mathcal{A}}$. The formula above follows by induction.

For a strategy as above,
$V_{\tau_{0}}D_{\tau_{0}} = \sum_{t > \tau_{0}}{A_{t}D_{t}|_{\mathcal{A}{\tau_{0}}} \geq 0}$.
Since $V_{0} = \Gamma_{0} \cdot X_{0}$,
$A_{0} = - \Gamma_{0} \cdot X_{0}$, and $D_{0} > 0$ we have
$A_{0} \leq 0$, where the 0 subscript denotes time $\tau_{0}$.
This proves the "easy" direction of the theorem.

There is no need to prove the "hard" direction since we have a large supply of arbitrage free models:
every model of the form
$X_{t}D_{t} = M_{t} - \sum_{s \leq t}{C_{s}D_{s}}$ where
$M_{t}:\mathcal{A}{t} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{I}$ is a martingale and
$D_{t}:\mathcal{A}{t} \rightarrow (0,\infty)$ 
is arbitrage-free. This is immediate by substituting
$X_{u}D_{u}$ in the first displayed equation.

## Examples

A _zero coupon bond_ maturing at time $u$, $D(u)$, has a single cash flow
$C^{D(u)}_u = 1$ so its price at time $t$ satisfies $X^{D(u)}_t D_t =
E_t 1 D_u$. We write $X^{D(u)}_t = D_t(u) = E_t D_u/D_t$ for its price at time $t$. In
particular $D_0(u) = E D_u$. Likewise, instruments that are a portfolio of
zero coupon bonds (e.g., cash deposits, forward rate agreements, swaps)
have a price that is determined by the deflator. All options on
such instruments also have prices determined by the deflator.

A _repurchase agreement_ at time $t$, $R_t$, has price $X^{R_t}_t = 1$
and cash flow $C^{R_t}_{t + dt} = R_t$ so for any arbitrage free model
$D_t = E_t[R_tD_{t+dt}]$.  Define the _forward repo rate_, $f_t$,
by $R_t = \exp(f_t\,dt)$ and the _canonical deflator_ to be $D_t =
\exp(-\int_0^t f_s\,ds)$.  The repos are arbitrage free for any forward
repo rate process.

Let $D_t = e^{-\rho t}$ and $M_t = (r, s e^{\sigma B_t - \sigma^2
t/2})$. This is the Black-Scholes/Merton model. No need for self-financing
portfolios, Ito's Lemma, or partial differential equations when using
the Unified Model.
