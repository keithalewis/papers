# Cumulants

The _cumulant_ of the random variable $X$ is $\kappa(s) = \log E e^sX$.

Note $\kappa(0) = 0$, $\kappa'(0) = E(X) and $\kappa''(0) = \Var(X)$.

The cumulants of $X$ are the coefficients in the power series
expansion $\kappa(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \kappa_n s^n/n!$.

The _standard normal_ random variable has density function
$\phi(x) = \exp(-x^2/2)/\sqrt(2\pi)$. Since $E[e^N]
