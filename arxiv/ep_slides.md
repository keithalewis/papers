# Efficient Portfolio

- An _efficient portfolio_ has the least variance among all portfolios
having the same expected return.  [Markowitz, Roy 1952]

- Every efficient portfolio is a sum of
spanned by any two linearly independent efficient portfolios

- For any $R_0$, $R_1$ independent and efficient, $R = (1 - \beta)R_0 + \beta R_1$
is also efficient.

$R - R_0 = \beta(R_1 - R_0)$ where  
$\beta = \Cov(R - R_0)/\Var(R_1 - R_0)$

# One-Period Model

$$
	R - R_0 = \beta(R_1 - R_0)
