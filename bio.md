Keith A. Lewis started his professional career as a J. D. Tamarkin
assistant professor at Brown where he pioneered the use of computers
as a classroom tool in mathematics. He went on to a Wall Street career
at Bankers Trust, Morgan Stanley, and Banc of America Securities where
his team built the equity derivative libraries used by the trading desk
to run their business.

Since 2002 Keith has been a consultant for hedge funds building
valuation models and tools for exploring, testing, and implementing
trading strategies. Other projects include insurance companies involved
with GPU computing, law firms certifying tax conformance of trades,
and municipal bond advance refunding.

He has spun off a number of open source projects based on his experience
with building tools his clients found useful and has been using them
in courses he has taught at NYU, Rutgers, Cornell, and Columbia.
