  Notes on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate
...

We quote rates instead of prices (1 - rate).

Let $F_j$ be the end-of-day, $t_j$, SOFR settlement rate
and $d^m_j$ the number of end-of-day quotes
in the $m$ months prior to $t_j$.
Define $\delta_j$ to be the number of days from $t_j$ to $t_{j+1}$
so $D^m_j = \sum_{k=1}^{d^m_j} \delta_{j - k}$ is the total
number of days in the $m$ months prior to $t_j$.

A one month SOFR futures final settlement quote is
$$\Phi^1_j
= \frac{1}{D^1_j} \sum_{k = 1}^{d^1_j} F_{j - k}\delta_{j - k}
$$
at time $t_j$, where $\delta_j$ is the number of days from $t_i$ to $t_{i+1}$.

A three month SOFR futures final settlement quote is
$$\Phi^3_j
= \frac{360}{D^3_j}\bigr([\Pi_{k=1}^{d^3_j}
(1 + F_{j - k}\delta_{j - k}/360)] - 1\bigr)
$$

Let $\phi^1(i, j)$ be the one month SOFR futures quote at time $t_i$
for the one month futures settling at $t_j$ and $\phi^3(i, j)$ be the
three month SOFR futures quote at time $t_i$ for the three month futures
settling at $t_j$. In any arbitrage free model we have $\phi^m(i, j) =
E_{t_i} \Phi^m(j)$ for $m\in\{1,3\}$.
