Algebras of sets are the mathematical model of _partial information_.

## Partition

An _algebra_ on the set $\Omega$ is a collectiono f sets that is closed
under complement and union, and contains the empty set. By De Morgan's
laws, the algebra is closed under intersections and contains $\Omega$.

For $\omega\in\Omega$ define $A_\omega = \cap\{B\colon \omega\in B, B\subseteq\Omega\}$.

A _partition_ of a set $\Omega$ is a collection of sets that are
mutually disjoint and contain every element of $\Omega$.  Mathematically,
a partition is a set of _atoms_ $\AA = \{A_i\}_{i\in I}$ where $A_i\cap
A_j= \emptyset$ is empty if $i\not=j$ and $\Omega = \cup_{i\in I} A_i$.

Partitions are used to represent partial information. Complete information would
be knowing the element $\omega\in\Omega$. Partial information is knowing what
atom $\omega$ belongs to. No information corresponds to the partition consisting
of the single set $\Omega$. Complete information corresponds to the partition
of all singleton sets $\{\omega\}$ where $\omega\in\Omega$.

The _algebra_ generated by a partition is $\{\cup_{j\in J} A_j:J\subseteq I\}$. 
It is closed under complement, union, and intersection.

## Measure 

A _measure_ is a function $P\colon\AA\to\RR$. It can be extended to the algebra
by defining $P(\cup_{j\in J} A_j) = \sum_{j\in J} P(A_j)$. 

A function $X\colon\Omega\to\RR$ is _measurable_ if $X$ is constant on the atoms of $\AA$,
so $X$ is a function $X\colon\AA\to\RR$.

We can integrate measurable functions over sets in the algebra:
$\int_{\cup_{j\in J} A_j} X\,dP = \sum_{j\in J} X(A_j) P(A_j)$.

## Conditional Expectation

If $P$ is a positive measure with mass 1, also called a _probability
measure_, and $X\colon\Omega\to\RR$, then $Y = E[X|\AA]$ is the
_conditional expectation_ of $X$ given $\AA$ if and only if $Y$ is $\AA$
measurable and $\int_A Y\,dP = \int_A X\,dP$ for all atoms $A\in\AA$.

If $\AA$ and $\BB$ are partitions we write $\AA\subseteq\BB$ if every atom
of $\AA$ is a union of atoms in $\BB$ and say $\BB$ is a _refinement_ of $\AA$.

If $X$ is $\BB$ measurable and $P$ is a measure on $\BB$ then
$Y(A)P(A) = \sum_{B\subset A} X(B) P(B)$ where $B$ ranges over atoms of $\BB$.
