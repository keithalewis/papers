Sigma algebras are overrated.

They are great for proofs involving $\lim_n\int f_n\,d\mu = \int\lim_n f_n\,d\mu$.

But they involve a lot of complicated machinery.

RRT: $X$ compact Hausdorff, $C(X)^* = M(X)$. The proof is hard.

Borel measure generated by open sets.

Baire measure generated by dense G-delta.

Ain't nobody got time fo' dat.

$X$ any set, $B(X)^* = ba(X)$. The proof is easy.

If an algebra is finite the atoms form a partition.

The partition represents _partial information_.

All probabilities are conditional probabilities

$E[X|\mathcal{A}] = (XP)|_{\mathcal{A}}$
