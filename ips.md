# IPS Summer Program

People use advanced tools without understanding their foundation.

Not only do they not understand when they are using them incorrectly, they are unable to understand how to use them.

More technically oriented to minimize language issues.

Projects that can be either technical or historical exposition.

Make sure students can be successful and gain confidence.

title: Mathematics and Computation

The _Curry-Howard Equivalence_ 

Logic: the foundation of mathematics (and, or, not, implies)

Lambda Calculus: computation (primative notions of computation)

Curry 1958: typed combinators are a representation of a proof

Howard 1969: formulas as types

Gentzen 1935: cut elimination theorem

Prawitz 1965: proof normalization

Tait 1965-7: beta-reduction is strongly normalizing


## Notes

Geometry: Greeks introduce notion of proofs

Many ways to prove a theorem.

George Boole: Laws of Thought
Reduce thought to algebra
[undefined/unresolved terms?]

Propositions.

Tautaulogies.

Proof from axioms.

Proof from trees.

Students write notes during the course about what interests them. Use as fodder for project.

Platonic solids
Plane symmetries
Math is truth

## From IPS

the lack of critical thinking, research skills and problem solving ability.
