# IPS Summer Program

Emphasize critical thinking, research skills and problem solving ability. 

People use advanced tools without understanding their foundation.

Not only do they not understand when they are using them incorrectly, they are unable to understand how to use them.

More technically oriented to minimize language issues.

Projects that can be either technical or historical exposition.

Make sure students can be successful and gain confidence.

title: Mathematics and Computation

The _Curry-Howard Equivalence_ 

Logic: the foundation of mathematics (and, or, not, implies)

Lambda Calculus: computation (primative notions of computation)

Curry 1958: typed combinators are a representation of a proof

Howard 1969: formulas as types

Gentzen 1935: cut elimination theorem

Prawitz 1965: proof normalization

Tait 1965-7: beta-reduction is strongly normalizing

## Notes

Geometry: Greeks introduce notion of proofs

Euclid 300BC Alexandria (Egypt)
Little is known biographically
Euclidean algorithm for gcd. (TLA+ proof systems?)
axioms vs postulates
Invented the Axiomatic system.
consistent, independent, complete

Models. Used to show consistency and independence.

Frege - sets
Peano - integers
? - real numbers

Many ways to prove a theorem.

George Boole: Laws of Thought
Reduce thought to algebra
[undefined/unresolved terms?]

Propositions.

Tautaulogies.

Proof from axioms.

Proof from trees.

Students write notes during the course about what interests them. Use as fodder for project.

Platonic solids
Plane symmetries
Math is truth

Use machine learning to find a truth table?

## Syllabus

Foundations of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

Everything comes from somewhere. Although AI and ML are cutting
edge area now they have their foundation in logic and computation.

Logic is the foundation of mathematics and the current theory was
promulgated by David Hilbert an others beginning in the late 19th century. In the
1930's Alonzo Church proposed a universal model for computaton called the
lambda-calculus. In the 1950's William Howard formalized an observation of
Haskel Curry to show how a certain subset of logic was precisely the same
as a certain fragment of lambda-calculus.  In the early 1970's Joachim
Lambek showed how to model these using cartesian closed categories.

While this may seem quite abstract, these are the foundation for some of the
latest advances in computer science. Functional programming is more than
just a fad, almost all machine learning algorithms are based on it.

## From IPS

the lack of critical thinking, research skills and problem solving ability. 

I think for the course content, you could teach mathematics , also you could include some knowledge related to computer science if needed. And for the research topics, they could be applied mathematics, such as sub topics related to financial mathematics or other topics that you think that is hot in real world application. 



WFF's

Be able to produce and recognize well formed formulas.

Truth Tables

complete given a WFF
Involve axioms to get them used to seeing patterns.

Proofs

Using axioms and modus ponens.

P => Q, P | Q

Hilbert axioms.

Tableau method. (Raymond Smulyan).
